Projects

### Project 1
* project1.c
* project1.h

This program contains functions that manipulate items in a linked list. It cointains funtions to add at the end or after a node, search for a node, print a node, print the list, delete a node or delete the entire list. It also has a main function that tests all of these functions.

### Project 2
* project2.c
* project2.h

This project reads the contents of the /etc/password file and outputs <username>:<shell> to the screen without the use of stdio.h and stdlib.h. Main returns an error if the file cannot be opened for reading.

### Project 3
* blink.c

This file alternates the blinking of two LEDs on and off using the GPIO pins on the raspberry pi and the bcm2835 library.

### Project 4
* binaryCounter.c
* binaryCounter.h
* main.c
* main.h
* Makefile - P4
* readButtonPress.c
* readButtonPress.h

This project reads the number of times the user presses a button and lights up the binary number representing that value with two LEDs using the GPIO pins on the raspberry pi. 

### Project 5
* I2C.c
* I2C.h
* PWM.c
* PWN.h
* MotorHat.c
* MotorHat.h
* Robot.c
* Robot.h
* Sensor.c
* Sensor.h
* RobotTest.c
* RobotTest.h
* Makefile

This project moves a robot forward if there are no objects coming up as detected by the sonic sensor otherwise if he is at most 30 cm away from an obstacle he moves backward and tries to go in another direction.
